# Social-Network-API

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
The application is an API for a social media startup's back end that uses a NoSQL database so that their website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. The requirements were as follows:

* When the user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
* When the user opens the API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* When the user tests the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in their database.
* When the user tests the API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.

## Usage
The following are screenshots of the API routes being tested in Insomnia

Get All Users:

Get User By Id:
![Get User By Id](./assets/images/GetById.png)

Post a Thought:
![Post a Thought](./assets/images/PostThought.png)

Update Thought:
![Put Thought](./assets/images/PutThought.png)

Delete a Reaction:
![Delete Reaction](./assets/images/DeleteReaction.png)

The models directory contains the schema for User, Thought, and Reaction. The controllers directory contains the Mongoose methods for each schema, and the routes directory contains the API routes that access the Mongoose methods. The app is run through opening server.js in an integrated terminal and by typing
`````````
npm start
`````````
into the command line. This will turn on the server at localhost:3001. The API routes can then be tested in Insomnia.
